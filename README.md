## About Python Programming

--> Python is a high-level, general-purpose, and very popular programming language.<br><br>
--> Python programming language (latest Python 3) is being used in web development, Machine Learning applications, along with all cutting-edge technology in Software Industry.<br><br>
--> Python is available across widely used platforms like Windows, Linux, and macOS.<br><br>
--> The biggest strength of Python is huge collection of standard library.<br>

## Mode of Execution Used  <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/img/colab_favicon_256px.png" title="Google Colab" alt="Google Colab" width="40" height="40">

--> Colaboratory, or ‚ÄúColab‚Äù for short, is a product from Google Research which allows anybody to write and execute python code in Jupyter notebook through the browser.<br><br>
--> Visit colab at:&nbsp; <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/"> <img src="https://colab.research.google.com/img/colab_favicon_256px.png" title="Google Colab" alt="Google Colab" width="40" height="40"></a><br><br>
--> Create account using google account.<br><br>
--> Once account creation is done, we can directly start coding in colab.<br><br>
--> It supports Python and R.<br><br>
--> Files are directly saved in Google Drive.<br><br>
--> To install python library this command is used-
```
pip install library_name 
```

## About Projects

<p>Complete Description about the project and resources used.</p>

## **1. Article Writing**

- My article delves into the world of **Hyperparameter Tuning**.<br><br>
- It offers a clear explanation of this crucial process in machine learning, detailing how fine-tuning these parameters can significantly boost model performance.<br><br>
- I've covered various techniques, providing practical insights and examples to help readers understand and implement them effectively.

## **2. Customer Churn Prediction**

- In this project I made a streamlit website in which you can apply multiple supervised learning algorithm on Customer churn dataset.<br><br>
- A multipage streamlit application is made which shows all stages of ml pipeline.<br><br>
- I also did Data Visualization to show the working of this algorithms on the dataset.<br><br>
- I have deployed this website using streamlit.<br><br>
- Visit Website from : <a href="https://customer-churn-prediction-ml-pipeline.streamlit.app/">Customer Churn Prediction</a>

## **3. World Cup 2023 Analysis**

- Data Visualization is the presentation of data in pictorial format.<br><br>
- Target was to see the performance analysis and variations using data visualization.<br><br>
- In this project visualization of CSV file containing data of players is done in python.<br><br>
- Data visualization is done to analyze performance of team and players.<br><br>
- Patterns found in the analysis are listed.

## Libraries Used

<p>Short Description about all libraries used in Project.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pandas (Panel Data/ Python Data Analysis) - This library is mostly used for analyzing,
cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.</li>
  <li>Matplotlib - It is a data visualization and graphical plotting library.</li>
<li>Seaborn - It is an extension of Matplotlib library used to create more attractive and
informative statistical graphics.</li>
  <li>Streamlit - It is a Python library that makes it easy to create and share web apps for machine learning and data science projects.</li>
</ul>
